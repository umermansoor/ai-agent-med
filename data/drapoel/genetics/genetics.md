| **LDLR Variant**              | Heterozygous              | Mild LDL clearance impairment                    | **↑** |
| **MTHFR (C677T)**             | CT (Heterozygous)         | Possible reduced folate metabolism               |       |
| **HLA-DQ2.5**                 | Negative                  | Not genetically predisposed to celiac disease    |       |
| **FTO (rs9939609)**           | AT (Heterozygous)         | ↑ Risk of obesity / higher BMI                   |       |
| **LCT (C/T-13910)**           | CC (Non-persistent)       | Likely lactose intolerance                       |       |

| **TCF7L2**                    | Risk allele present       | ↑ Risk for type 2 diabetes                       | *↑*   |
| **TGFB1 Variant**             | Wild-type                 | No increased fibrosis risk                       |       |

## Interpretation

- **Cardiovascular Risk:** Presence of APOE E4 allele and LDLR variant are consistent with Drapoel’s **elevated LDL cholesterol** and **increased cardiovascular risk**.  
- **Metabolic Risk:** TCF7L2 variant supports the **prediabetes (HbA1c 5.9%)** finding.  
- **Endocrine Risk:** No direct thyroid-associated mutations, but mild metabolic risk could compound hypothyroidism.  
- **Lifestyle Traits:**  
  - **Caffeine sensitivity** → likely to experience jitters or slower caffeine breakdown.  
  - **Lactose intolerance** → predisposed to GI symptoms with dairy.  
  - **FTO variant** → tendency toward weight gain with poor diet/exercise.
