## Interpretation

- **Cardiovascular Risk:** Presence of APOE E4 allele and LDLR variant are consistent with Drapoel’s **elevated LDL cholesterol** and **increased cardiovascular risk**.  
- **Metabolic Risk:** TCF7L2 variant supports the **prediabetes (HbA1c 5.9%)** finding.  
- **Endocrine Risk:** No direct thyroid-associated mutations, but mild metabolic risk could compound hypothyroidism.  
- **Lifestyle Traits:**  
  - **Caffeine sensitivity** → likely to experience jitters or slower caffeine breakdown.  
  - **Lactose intolerance** → predisposed to GI symptoms with dairy.  
  - **FTO variant** → tendency toward weight gain with poor diet/exercise.
