        "content": "The patient's fatigue is multifactorial, primarily due to:\n\n1. **Hypothyroidism** — Lab results show TSH 8.2 (high) and Free T4 0.6 (low), which is diagnostic for primary hypothyroidism. This condition directly causes fatigue, sluggishness, cold intolerance, and weight gain.\n\n2. **Vitamin D Deficiency** — Level of 22 ng/mL (below 30). Low vitamin D contributes to muscle weakness, low mood, and tiredness.\n\n3. **Prediabetes** — HbA1c 5.9% is in the prediabetic range. This can cause fluctuations in blood sugar and post-meal fatigue.\n\n4. **Lifestyle & Sleep Factors** — Patient reports ~6 hours of sleep/night, sedentary occupation, limited exercise, and diet high in processed foods, all of which worsen low energy.\n\n5. **Systemic Inflammation** — hs-CRP 3.6 mg/L (>3.0 = high risk). Chronic inflammation contributes to malaise and fatigue.\n\n**Clinical Impression:** The fatigue is most directly attributable to untreated hypothyroidism, compounded by low vitamin D, prediabetes, poor lifestyle habits, and systemic inflammation.",
