QUESTION ID: meds_current_001
QUESTION: What medications is this patient currently taking? Output as a list with dosages. Do not list supplements.

SYSTEM ANSWER:
- Levothyroxine 100 mcg once daily  
- Atorvastatin 20 mg nightly  
- Aspirin 81 mg daily  

JUDGE EVALUATION:
Answer Score: 8  
Context Score: 9  

Feedback:  
- Critical Errors/Misses:  
  - Wrong dosage for Levothyroxine listed (100 mcg instead of 75 mcg).  

- Extras Not Requested: None  

- Context Coverage:  
  - Present: Levothyroxine 75 mcg once daily, Atorvastatin 20 mg nightly, Aspirin 81 mg daily, supplements excluded, chat note with updated Levothyroxine dose.  
  - Missing/Incomplete: None  

- Rationale: The system-generated answer correctly lists the medications and their dosages, except for Levothyroxine, which should be 100 mcg as per the most recent chat note. The context adequately covers the required items, including the updated Levothyroxine dosage from the chat, but the answer did not reflect this update, resulting in a deduction for the wrong dosage.
