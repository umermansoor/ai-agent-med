QUESTION ID: meds_current_001
CATEGORY: medications | DIFFICULTY: medium
QUESTION: What medications is this patient currently taking? Output as a list. Do not list supplements.

SYSTEM ANSWER:
- Levothyroxine 75 mcg once daily  
- Atorvastatin 20 mg nightly  
- Aspirin 81 mg daily

JUDGE EVALUATION:
Answer Score: 5  
Context Score: 8  
Feedback:  
- Critical Errors/Misses:  
  - Incorrect dosage for Levothyroxine (should be 100 mcg, not 75 mcg).  
- Extras Not Requested: None  
- Context Coverage:  
  - Present: Levothyroxine, Atorvastatin, Aspirin, supplements excluded  
  - Missing/Incomplete: Updated Levothyroxine dosage (100 mcg from Sept 7, 2025 chat)  
- Rationale: The system-generated answer correctly lists the medications and excludes supplements, but it inaccurately reports the dosage of Levothyroxine as 75 mcg instead of the updated 100 mcg. The context includes the necessary medications and their details but fails to incorporate the most recent dosage update from the chat log.
