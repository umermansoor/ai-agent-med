JUDGE EVALUATION:
=== CONTEXT EVALUATION ===
The retrieved context contains the necessary information to answer the question about the patient's current medications, including the updated dosage of Levothyroxine. The context lists the medications, their dosages, and frequencies, and it correctly reflects the updated Levothyroxine dosage of 100 mcg daily as mentioned in the chat log. The supplements are also listed separately, which aligns with the requirement to exclude them from the answer. 

However, the context includes a significant amount of additional information, such as family history, allergies, and supplements, which could potentially confuse the LLM. This additional information is not directly relevant to answering the question about current prescription medications.

Evaluation:
- The context includes all necessary information to answer the question correctly: 0 points deducted.
- The context contains more than 50% irrelevant information: -2 points deducted.

Final Context Score: 8

=== ANSWER EVALUATION ===
The system-generated answer contains all the required information present in the golden reference answer. The medications, dosages, and frequencies are accurately reported. The only minor difference is in the wording of the times for taking the medications, but this does not affect the factual accuracy or understanding for a medical professional. Therefore, no penalties are applied.

Final Score: 10
