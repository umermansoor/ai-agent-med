QUESTION ID: meds_current_001
QUESTION: What medications is this patient currently taking? Output as a list with dosages. Do not list supplements.

SYSTEM ANSWER:
- Levothyroxine 75 mcg once daily (increasing to 100 mcg daily as per recent adjustment)
- Atorvastatin 20 mg nightly
- Aspirin 81 mg daily

JUDGE EVALUATION:
Answer Score: 8  
Context Score: 9  
Feedback:  
- Critical Errors/Misses:  
  - Incorrect dosage for Levothyroxine; should be 100 mcg once daily as per the most recent chat update.  
- Extras Not Requested: None  
- Context Coverage:  
  - Present: Levothyroxine 75 mcg once daily, Atorvastatin 20 mg nightly, Aspirin 81 mg daily, supplements listed separately, chat note with dose update to 100 mcg.  
  - Missing/Incomplete: Levothyroxine 100 mcg once daily (most recent dosage).  
- Rationale: The system-generated answer incorrectly lists the Levothyroxine dosage as 75 mcg instead of the updated 100 mcg from the chat note, resulting in a deduction for accuracy. The context is mostly complete but does not reflect the most recent dosage update, leading to a minor deduction.
