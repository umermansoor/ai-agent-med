JUDGE EVALUATION:
=== CONTEXT EVALUATION ===
The retrieved context contains the necessary information to answer the question about the patient's current medications, including the updated dosage of Levothyroxine. However, it also includes a significant amount of irrelevant information, such as details about supplements and family history, which could potentially confuse the LLM. 

Evaluation:
- The context correctly includes the updated Levothyroxine dosage of 100 mcg daily, as indicated in the chat log.
- The context also lists Atorvastatin 20 mg nightly and Aspirin 81 mg daily, which matches the golden reference.
- However, the context includes more than 50% irrelevant information, such as supplements and family history, which are not needed to answer the question.

Score Calculation:
- No points deducted for missing information, as all required medication details are present.
- -2 points deducted for containing more than 50% irrelevant information.

Final Context Score: 8

=== ANSWER EVALUATION ===
The system-generated answer contains all the required information present in the golden reference answer. The medications, dosages, and frequencies are accurately reported. The only minor difference is in the wording of the times ("AM" vs. "morning" and "PM" vs. "nightly"), but these differences do not affect the factual accuracy of the information and would be understood by a medical professional. Therefore, no penalties are applied for these minor language differences.

Final Score: 10
