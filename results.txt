QUESTION ID: meds_current_001
QUESTION: What medications is this patient currently taking? Output as a list with dosages. Do not list supplements.

SYSTEM ANSWER:
The patient is currently taking the following prescription medications:

1. Levothyroxine 100 mcg once daily
2. Atorvastatin 20 mg nightly
3. Aspirin 81 mg daily

JUDGE EVALUATION:
Answer Score: 8  
Context Score: 9  
Feedback:  
- Critical Errors/Misses:  
  - Incorrect dosage for Levothyroxine (listed as 100 mcg instead of 75 mcg).  
- Extras Not Requested: None  
- Context Coverage:  
  - Present: Levothyroxine, Atorvastatin, Aspirin, chat note with updated Levothyroxine dose  
  - Missing/Incomplete: None  
- Rationale: The system-generated answer incorrectly lists the dosage of Levothyroxine as 100 mcg, which is not supported by the most recent context. The context is mostly complete, but the system-generated answer should have reflected the updated dosage from the chat note.
